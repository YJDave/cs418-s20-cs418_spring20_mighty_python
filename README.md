### How to use our project

## Data

1. In the data directory you see our cleaned data, the main files include ```best_value_data.csv```, ```major_classifier.csv```, ```school_classifier.csv```, and ```all_school_classifier.csv```

2. ```best_value_data.csv``` contains our cleaned dataset with the best value column calcuated from earnings divided by debt

3. ```major_classifier.csv```, ```school_classifier.csv```, and ```all_school_classifier.csv``` contains the dataframe as a CSV from the data prepared for the classifier functions. This makes it easy to pass through to our classifier class.
